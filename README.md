This repository contains oops programs using C++ with lab record file.

## Syllabus for the OOPS_Lab::
1. Write a program to read a matrix of size mxn from the keyboard and display the same using function.
2. Program to make the use of inline function.
3. Write a function power() which raise a number m to a power n. The function takes double value of m and interger value of n and returns the result. Use a default value of n is 2 to make the function to calculate square when this argument is ommited.
4. Program to show that the effect of default arguments can be alternatively achieved by overlaoding.
5. Write a class ACCOUNT that represents your bank account and then use it. The class should allow you to deposit money, withdreaw money, calculate interest, send you a message if you have insufficient balance.
6. Write a class STRING that can be used ot store strings, add strings, equate strings and output strings.
7. Create the class TIME to store time in hours and minutes. Write a friend function to add two TIME objects.
8. Create a class DM and DB, DM stores the distance in meter and centimeters and DB stores the distance in feet and inches. Write a program to add object of DM with the object of DB class.
9. Write a program to create and abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named number_of_sides(). Provide three classes named Trapezoid, Triangle and Hexagon such tha t each one of the classes inherits the class shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method number_of_sides() that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical figures.
10. Program to demonstrate the concept of: a) Default constructor b) Parameterized constructor c) Copy constructor d) Constructor overloading
11. Program to demonstrate the concept of destructor.
12. Program to show multiple inheritence.
13. Program to show multilevel inheritence.
14. Program to show hybrid inheritence.
15. Program to show the concept of containership.
16. Program to overlaod unary operator.
17. Program to overlaod binary operator.
18. Program to show the concept of run time polymorphism using virtual function.
19. Program to work with formatted and unformatted IO operations.
20. Program to read the name and roll number of students from keyboard and write them into a file and then display it.
21. Program to copy one file onto the ened of another, adding line numbers.
22. Write a function template for finding the minimum value contained in an array.
